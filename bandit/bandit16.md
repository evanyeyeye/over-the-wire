# Bandit 16

The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to port 30001 on localhost using SSL encryption.

Helpful note: Getting “HEARTBEATING” and “Read R BLOCK”? Use -ign_eof and read the “CONNECTED COMMANDS” section in the manpage. Next to ‘R’ and ‘Q’, the ‘B’ command also works in this version of that command…

**Solution**

```
bandit14@melinda:~$ cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 | nc localhost 30000
Correct!
