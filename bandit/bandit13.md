# Bandit 13

The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which is a hexdump of a file that has been repeatedly compressed. For this level it may be useful to create a directory under /tmp in which you can work using mkdir. For example: mkdir /tmp/myname123. Then copy the datafile using cp, and rename it using mv (read the manpages!).

**Solution**

```
bandit13@melinda:~$ ls
sshkey.private
bandit13@melinda:~$ ssh -i sshkey.private bandit14@localhost
Could not create directory '/home/bandit13/.ssh'.
The authenticity of host 'localhost (127.0.0.1)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is 05:3a:1c:25:35:0a:ed:2f:cd:87:1c:f6:fe:69:e4:f6.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
```
